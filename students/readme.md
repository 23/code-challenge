# Student Engineer  Challenge

The output of this assingement should be a github repository.

the repo should contain the code and a good readme on how to use the test/run the project.

├── src (Your source code)
│   ├── filename1.ext
│   └── filename.ext
├── test (Your tests)
│   ├── testX.ext
│   ├── test_should.ext
│   └── test_spec.ext
└── README.md
```
