# Student Engineer  Challenge

The output of this assignment should be a github repository.

The repo should contain the code and a good readme on how to use the test/run the project.

Try to structure the repository like this:

```console
├── src (Your source code)
│   ├── filename1.ext
│   └── filename.ext
├── test (Your tests)
│   ├── testX.ext
│   ├── test_should.ext
│   └── test_spec.ext
└── README.md
```

## Expectations

You should use all the tools you know and have available to make this as simple for you as possible.
We are not looking for perfectly indented code or fancy architectural patterns, we are interested in
how you think and work with code.
